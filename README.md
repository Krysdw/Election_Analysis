Election Analysis

Overview
The purpose of the Election Analysis is to satisfy the additional requested information from the election commission. The following additional information has been requested:
•	The voter turnout for each county
•	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
•	The county with the highest turnout

To get the requested information we will:
•	Initialize a county list
•	Initialize a dictionary
•	Initialize an empty string & variable
•	Write a decision statement with conditions
•	Write a script & Print statement

Summary of Alternate Script Uses
The script can also be used in presidential election by broadening the dataset to include a state column. Additionally, using decision statements to capture votes by state and county, looping through each county in that state and then onto the next state’s set of counties. 

A second example using the same presidential election dataset (including state) would be to look at for instance the way women voted in each state and county by age. We would then broaden the dataset to include sex and age and perhaps party. Then repeating the loop through each state and county with decision statements based on sex.
